        - Shared Data(Prone to error)
        - Message Passing(Safer) - uses pipes/sockets/RPC


USE CASES:
    - Infomation sharing
    - Computation speedup

Events:
    - Window
    - Window New
    - Window Close
    - Window Focus
    - Window Move
    - Window Floating
    - Window Fullscreen Mode
    - Window Mark
