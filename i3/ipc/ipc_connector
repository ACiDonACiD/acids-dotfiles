- Interfacing i3 from within a seperate process
- Inter-process communication(IPC)
- IPC method: unix socket

By default i3 will set the path of the IPC socket based on:
    1. The +ipc-socket+ configuration directive was provided
    2. The +I3SOCK+ environment variable was provided
    3. +$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/i3/ipc-socket.%p+; (i3 PiD = %p)
        - ('%p') is the PID of i3.

    4. +/tmp/i3-%u.XXXXXX/ipc-socket.%p+
        - ('%u') is your UNIX username
        - ('XXXXXX') is a string of random characters

    NOTE:   You can get the 'socketpath' by executing +i3 --get-socketpath+; This flag will print the-
            path on a new line to statndard output.(The socket produced by i3,
            is the resulting environment variable +$I3SOCK+)
