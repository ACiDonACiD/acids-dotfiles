This file lists all files in the complete Autodoc 1.0 distribution,
organized according to their standard layout on UNIX systems.
It shows which files each version requires, so you can remove or
skip unnecessary ones when transferring Autodoc to another system.

(Note: This list excludes Git-related dotfiles.)

NOTE: This list reflects the full source distribution of Autodoc 1.0.
      Some files may not appear in minimal runtime environments, as they are
      only required during development, documentation generation, or build-time.

      All files listed here should remain in the source tree to ensure a complete
      and functional build, even if they are not part of the final output.
