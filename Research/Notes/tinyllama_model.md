ollama version is 0.9.0

## Some alternative models of llama

## ‚úÖ Step-by-Step: First Model with Ollama

### üê™ 1. **Verify Ollama CLI is installed**

Run in terminal:

```bash
ollama --version
```

You should see something like:

```
ollama version 0.x.x
```

---

### üß† 2. **Choose a lightweight starter model**

Great first options:

* `tinyllama` (110M) ‚Äî very fast, great for summaries, basic Q\&A
* `mistral` (7B) ‚Äî more capable, still runs well on decent CPUs or any GPU
* `llama2` ‚Äî standard general-purpose model
* `gemma` ‚Äî lightweight and good for reasoning

Let‚Äôs go with `tinyllama` first.

---

### üì• 3. **Pull the model**

```bash
ollama pull tinyllama
```

This will download the GGUF model and set it up for you.

---

### üí¨ 4. **Chat with it**

```bash
ollama run tinyllama
```

Example:

```text
>>> How do I write a bash script that logs to a JSON file?
```

---

### ‚úçÔ∏è 5. **Use Ollama non-interactively (shell integration)**

```bash
echo "Summarize this: The script processes log entries and outputs them to .jsonl files." | ollama run tinyllama
```

Want to wrap this into a Bash script like `summarize.sh`? Here's an example:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# summarize.sh
ollama run tinyllama <<EOF
Summarize this content:
$(cat "$1")
EOF
```

Usage:

```bash
chmod +x summarize.sh
./summarize.sh ./README.md
```

---

## üì¶ Bonus: Install a more powerful model

```bash
ollama pull mistral
ollama run mistral
```

Or if you want code generation and explanation:

```bash
ollama pull codellama
ollama run codellama
```

---

## ‚úÖ Ready for Integration?

Let me know if you'd like me to:

* Build `summarize.sh` or `describe.sh` into your system
* Make an AI-enhanced `meta-track` or `smartlog`
* Integrate with your `fzf`, tagging, or metadata tools

You're now ready to power up your doc stack with local LLMs ‚Äî let‚Äôs build something cool next.
